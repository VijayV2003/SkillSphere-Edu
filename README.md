**CSS3 **– Used for styling, layouts, and responsiveness.
**Flexbox & Grid **– Likely used for aligning elements and managing layouts.
**CSS Animations & Transitions **– For smooth effects and interactive UI elements.

**Additional Enhancements **
**Google Fonts / Custom Fonts **– For typography styling.
**FontAwesome / Icons **– If any icons are present.
